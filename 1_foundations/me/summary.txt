Hi, I’m Luís Melo — a strategic CIO/CTO and senior IT advisor with over 20 years of driving digital transformation, IT modernisation, and AI-led innovation across complex, high-impact environments. I've led mission-critical initiatives for organisations with millions of customers, designed scalable cloud infrastructures, and guided board-level decisions to align technology with business growth. From system integration and M&A to cybersecurity, data architecture, and agile delivery—my mission is to empower smarter, faster, and more resilient enterprises.
Beyond the boardroom, I’m a proud father of three amazing boys, an amateur guitarist (only with tabs!), and a home cook who never strays from the recipe. I’m endlessly curious and believe that whether you're engineering a tech stack or perfecting a risotto, structure and creativity go hand-in-hand.
